The ambience of the almost-empty Shibuii in Bandra was almost as confusing as its menu.
 This pan-Asian cuisine restaurant had palm leaves plastered across its walls and 
Devil’s ivy creeping out of its ceiling, with a few stray, metallic mushrooms hung like a
 work of art on an accent wall, accompanied with mood lighting. Each dish on the menu had 
its place of origin — Cambodia, Thailand and Vietnam, among others — mentioned right next to them.
 Also keeping in mind Indian customers, the menu specified ‘Jain’,
 ‘Vegan’ and ‘Gluten-free’ options as well.

Vietnam is one of Southeast Asia’s most beautiful countries, 
attracting travellers to its lush mountains, bustling cities
 and golden sand beaches. Despite rapid modernisation in Vietnam’s 
urban centres of Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh, time-honoured traditions remain 
intact amongst the locals. There are numerous ancient landmarks and colonial
 structures that have survived throughout the bumps and scrapes of history.

<p >Japan is an island nation in East Asia. Located in the Pacific Ocean, it borders China, North Korea, South Korea, Russia, Taiwan, the Sea of Japan, the Sea of Okhotsk, and the East China Sea. It is an archipelago of 6,852 islands, most of which are mountainous, and many are volcanic. </p>

<p >Called the “Land of Smiles,” Thailand has become one of the leading travel destinations in Asia over the last few decades. Officially known as the Kingdom of Thailand, this Southeast Asian nation is the only country in the region to have avoided colonialism, remaining a sovereign country in its own right. Economically, Thailand is still developing, although this doesn’t stop it from dominating much of the region’s rice and tourism industries. </p>
